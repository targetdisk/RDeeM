This is a tool that lets you use MacBook Pro Retina's highest and unsupported resolutions.
As an example, a Retina MacBook Pro 13" can be set to 3360×2100 maximum resolution, as
opposed to Apple's max supported 1680×1050. It is accessible from the menu bar.

You should prefer resolutions marked with ⚡️ (lightning), which indicates the resolution
is HiDPI or 2× or more dense in pixels.

For more practical results, add RDM.app to your Login Items in **System Preferences ➡ Users & Groups ➡ Login Items**.
This way RDM will run automatically on startup.

This software was studied and released [here](http://garethjenkins.com/2012/07/01/investigating-a-high-resolution-retina-utility-for-macbook-pro-1x-and-2x-modes/#comment-623)
and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/vi9yf/set_your_retina_macbook_pros_resolution_to/)
by its original authors. I just improved the build system and Makefile, fixed the icon,
added support for easy installable package (PKG, DMG) and improved the way menu is
displayed.  I'm sure they would enjoy you to freely use it under the AGPLv3 license. Me too.

Want installable binary package? [It is here](http://avi.alkalay.net/software/RDM/).
